### Hi ###
1. This is project is founded in 2020 during pandemic, while my classmates peer pressured me to do Leetcode.  I thought it's fun to write this down so maybe after a few years when all these non-senses are over, I can have a laugh, providing I survive the pandemic, of course.
2. This is just a code dump. You can't really run anything since I am too lazy to write a driver.
